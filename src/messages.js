      "The man, the myth, the legend... With an impressive score of **points**, **name** keeps amazing the world and making his partner the luckiest human being alive. What else can be said about someone who turned the extraordinary into routine, the unattainable into everyday life? The mastery with which he performs in all areas of the relationship makes him the model that everyone imitates but no one reaches. How difficult for his contemporaries to compare ourselves to such a high standard, but how fortunate we are for the opportunity to learn from him!",
      "**name**: the demigod of love and empathy. The hero who everyday restores the faith of humanity in the possibility of relationships. The mind that when speaking of love makes Shakespeare sound like a lawyer reciting the penal code. The seasoned lover, next to whom adult film legends seem like prudish Victorians. The figure who exhausted all adjectives and forced poets to invent new ones. The icon of the ages, whose only flaw is that he makes his partner feel a little ashamed of having such good luck. A perfect score. Nothing to add.",
